# Run Biome Check

After making any changes to the codebase (editing, creating, or deleting files), you MUST run `bunx biome check` to ensure there are no linting or formatting errors.

If `biome check` reports any errors, you MUST fix them before considering the task complete.

Usage:
`bunx biome check`
