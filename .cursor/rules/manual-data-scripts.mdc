# Manual Execution of Data Retrieval Scripts

When the user asks for a script to retrieve data (e.g., fetching from an API, scraping, database queries):
1.  Write or provide the script code.
2.  **Do not** automatically execute the script using `run_terminal_cmd`.
3.  Instruct the user to run the script manually in their terminal.

This applies to scripts intended to fetch, scrape, or download data, particularly those in the `scripts/` directory or named with `fetch`, `retrieve`, or similar keywords.
